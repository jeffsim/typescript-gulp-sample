    <!-- Jasmine (testing) related scripts
         NOTE: This requires that you've done the following from terminal: npm install jasmine
         If you installed jasmine globally then tweak the src tags accordingly.  If Jasmine has changed since
         I wrote this, or the includes otherwise don't work, then just try http://bit.ly/2gUKQg7
         
         TODO: what's the 'right' way to do this?  I don't want to install it into a 'tools' folder
         because I want npm install to handle that for me. Hm.
